A little network analysis example. The data come from an appendix to David Hackett Fischer's *Paul Revere's Ride* (Oxford University Press, 1995). Put up to accompany this blog post: http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/

The data produced by the analysis here do not exactly match those in the blog post, due to errors in the original data (fixed in https://github.com/kjhealy/revere/pull/1). For instance, the corrected Organization-by-Organization matrix has 16 people common to LondonEnemies and NorthCaucus, not 20.
